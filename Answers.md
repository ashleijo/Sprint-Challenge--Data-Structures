# Stacks follow the last-in-first-out principal (LIFO). Only the last object that was inserted may be removed. Inserting an item is a "push", removing an item is a "pop". A candy PEZ dispenser may serve as an analogy (the candies that were last inserted into the dispenser are the first to be served to the consumer).
# Queues follow the first-in-first-out principal (FIFO). The object that has been in the queue the longest is at the front, and is the only one that may be removed. Inserting an item (at the rear), is an "enqueue" and removing an item (from the front), is a "dequeue". A store check-out lane may serve as an analogy (the person at the front of the line will be served first while the person at the end of the line will be served last).
# For a Linked List, the retrieval time correlates with the amount of data that is present. More data, more time.
# For a Hash Table, the retrieval time will always be consistent and is not affected by the amount of data.
# For a Binary Search Tree, the retrieval time also correlates with the amount of data, but the amount of data that it's searching through is "halved" with each tree level.
# Some advantages of using a Hash Table over an array in JS is that through hashing, specific values can be immediately found. Arrays must be sorted/iterated through from the beginning (loop) in order to find a specific value. Overall, hash tables provide results faster and more efficiently.
